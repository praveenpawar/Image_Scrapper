# Image_Scrapper

Code works well with Python 3.6 version, for that we need to create virtual environment. 

>> Need to run the below conda command to create the virtusla enviroment.

conda create -n image_scrapper python=3.6 

>> To activate this virtual enviroment.

conda activate image_scrapper

>> now check the python version. it should give python version 3.6

python --version

>> Now for running this code, need some modules. for that we have requirements.txt file. you can run the below command to install all the modules.

pip install -r requirements.txt

>> Once we are able to install all the required the module now we are good to run the python code.

python scrapper.py

Note: In code, you can change the search term and the image number.
